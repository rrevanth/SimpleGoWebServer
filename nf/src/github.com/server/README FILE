This project is in GO Language.

The Server file is in server.go and the Test file is in server_test.go

Server.go has  three functions : main , viewHandler and getResponse


Whole processing is done in getResponse, No thrid libraries are used in creating the server

To Run the server :

Go in to the server namespace and add it to GOPATH

export GOPATH = "your namespace path"

In the src folder :

go run server.go

This will run the server instant on localhost:8080


user.json is loaded only once.Hence if user.json is modified server needs to be restarted or else

you can remove the condition against the getrecords to load it for every request

All Use cases have been considered and tested accordingly
